Easy and simple setup and insertion of PayPal donate buttons with a shortcode. Donation purpose can be set for each button. A few other customization options are available as well.

== Description ==

Adds a PayPal donation shortcode to WordPress. The options menu lets you setup you PayPal ID and a few other optional settings. You can choose which donation button you want to use or if you want to use your own button. You can also set an optional default purpose and reference which can be overridden on each inserted instance with the shortcode options. There is also settings for currency, custom payment page style and the return page.

Insert the button in your pages or posts with this shortcode

`[paypal-donation]`

Which is the simples option, and uses all default and optional settings. If you want to make a specific button for a specific purpose you can add these options:

`[paypal-donation purpose="Spline Importer" reference="3D Plugins"]`

as an example.
